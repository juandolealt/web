# Getting Started

## What is Smart Wallet?

Smart Wallet is the fastest way for users to connect to your app, onramp in seconds, and experience world-class onchain UX:

- **Universal account:** An account that just works anywhere your users go.
- **Instant onboarding:** Bring users onchain in seconds with secure passkey sign-in. No app or extension required.
- **Onchain made simple:** Build delightful user experiences with sponsored transactions, spend permissions, and batch operations.
- **Built-in onramps:** Simple account funding for users â€” with Apple Pay, debit card, or Coinbase Exchange balances.
- **Free to use:** Smart Wallet is 100% free for users and developers. No fees whatsoever.

## Quick Start with OnchainKit

We recommend starting a new OnchainKit app using `create onchain`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash [Terminal]
npm create onchain@latest
```

After the prompts, `create onchain` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.
